# Body Fat by Underwater Weighing
### Body fat is expensive and unwieldy to measure directly, as it involves underwater weighing.
### Thus it would be highly desirable to predict this quantity from easily measurable variables such as height, age, weight, abdome circumference and so on.
### This is a dataframe containing the estimates of the percentage of body fat determined by underwater weighing (fat_class) and various body circumference measurements for 252 men.
